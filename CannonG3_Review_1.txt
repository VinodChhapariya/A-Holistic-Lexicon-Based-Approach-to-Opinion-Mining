i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase .
the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group . 
after i took their picture with their camera , they offered to take a picture of us . 
i just told them , press halfway , wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way . 
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) . 
a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality . 
i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with visable gain in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) . 
ensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras . 
bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices . 
i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to 
adjust if you like . 
great job canon !
